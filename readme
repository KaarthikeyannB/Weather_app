This Weather App is a fully responsive and user-friendly application designed to provide real-time weather updates and historical trends for any city around the globe. Built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS, the app leverages the WeatherAPI to fetch accurate and detailed weather data. It displays key information such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed, all wrapped in a visually appealing interface with dynamic background images that reflect current weather. To manage global state effectively, Redux and Redux Toolkit are usedâ€”handling user searches, favourites, and API data seamlessly across components. The app also includes robust error handling to manage invalid or misspelled city names by reverting to the last valid search result. A key feature of the app is its integration of interactive charts, which visualize the weather trends over the past 5 days for any searched location, offering users a better understanding of changing conditions. Additionally, the app includes smooth loading spinners and a favourites section where users can save frequently searched cities. With a well-structured codebase and clean architecture, this weather app demonstrates a modern approach to building scalable and interactive front-end applications.
